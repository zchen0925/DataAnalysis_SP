Scripts to get single word frequency and bigram surprisal of sentences
MH, written 2022

Dictionaries: 

- wordDict.pickle = contains frequency values for single words

- gramDict_combined.pickle = contains frequency values for single words AND surprisal values for bigrams

Scripts:

- getngrams.py = series of functions you need to interface with the Google ngrams corpus. Found this on github, was written by someone else

- getngrams_dict_freq.py = populate your wordDict dictionary with frequency of single words in your stimuli

- getngrams_dict_surprisal.py = populate your gramDict_combined dictionary with surprisal of bigrams in your stimuli

- calculate_avgfreq.py = calculate average frequency within and across sentences

- calculate_avgsurprisal.py = calculate average surprisal within and across sentences

CSVs:

- curr_stim.csv = the stimuli you want to analyze

- failed_grams.csv = a list of bigrams from my stimuli that did not show up in the corpus. Might be helpful to compare to your stimuli if you run into a similar problem

- wordfreq_results.csv = example of what word frequency results look like

- surprisal_results_2grams.csv = example of what bigram surprisal results look like
